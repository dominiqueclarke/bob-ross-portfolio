                As a front end engineer, it's my joy to delight users. Few
                things make me happier than when a user says "oh, wow, cool!" In
                the pursuit of building functional and beautiful software that
                users love, I am continuously expanding my knowledge of
                development, design, and product management, and team
                leadership. I have worked on numerous front end projects and a
                hand full of back-end applications for an enterprise Fortune 500
                company and a quickly scaling Deloitte Fast 500 startup. I am
                most proficient with JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML and SCSS,
                which I've used to build scalable, performant, accessible, and
                beautiful user interfaces for enterprise web applications. I've
                also contributed back end .NET code. Below you can see samples
                of personal projects built with Angular, Node.js, Mongo,
                Express, and a few extras like Mapbox and Pixi.js. Additionally
                I've worked with Java and Spring. While I enjoy learning new
                technologies, I also enjoy teaching technologies I'm familiar
                with. In my current role as a Software Developer for Think
                Company, I mentor junior devs and give talks on the latest front
                end technologies at our UI Guild. As a technical instructor for
                Zip Code Wilmington, I helped students from non-technical
                backgrounds achieve their dreams of becoming professional
                software developers by developing and delivering curriculum
                focused on Java, Spring, Angular 2+, test-driven development,
                design patterns, cloud applications and best practices for
                writing clean code. In the past as a co-organizer and teacher
                for Girl Develop It, I helped equip adult women with new tech
                skills and introduce them to careers they'll love. I still enjoy
                delivering talks to the greater tech community, and recently
                gave a talk on Breaking Into Tech for Women Who Code Dallas. As
                a member of a development team, I hope to learn and to teach, to
                mentor and be mentored, working collaboratively to build useful,
                elegant and visually stunning web applications that people enjoy
                using day after day.
